# Problem-Framing:

**In the ever-evolving landscape of music streaming apps, there exists a crucial gap in the realm of personalized music recommendations. While most platforms offer song suggestions based on past listening habits and preferred genres, there is an unmet need for a Music Mood Recommender System that caters to the emotional context of the listener. This recommender system aims to target the everyday music enthusiast, who seeks to enhance their music experience by harmonizing their mood with the tunes they encounter.**

# Key achievements:

*Keeping this in mind, developed a python-shiny product (web app) that recommends a song on the basis of cosine similarity of the songs.*

*The algorithm uses cosine similarity to recommend similar songs.*

*Created different moods of the songs and classified them as happy, sad, energetic and calm.*
